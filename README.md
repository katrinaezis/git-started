Hello!
  I do not yet know who you are, because there is not a TA assigned to my section yet, but I'm sure you'll be great! I'm really excited to jump into this quarter and start learning all the things about all the stuff. It's currently 4:43 AM so things and stuff is the best I can do...sorry. I swear I'm more eloquent at normal human hours! I can't wait to meet you and start working this quarter.

  Best, 
     Katrina Ezis
